      <h2>Tax and Regulatory</h2>

      <h3>Direct Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        Direct taxation in India broadly refers to the Income Tax and Wealth tax
        laws which involve personal tax, corporate tax, minimum alternate tax,
        capital gains tax, international tax and transfer pricing.
      </p>

      <h3>Indirect Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        With the introduction of Goods & Services Tax, indirect taxation in
        India has taken a new direction. Many other indirect taxes like VAT,
        Service Tax etc have been done away with and only one tax – GST is
        applicable.
      </p>

        We offer services in each of the above-mentioned areas of tax and
        regulatory compliance.

      <h3>Transfer Pricing</h3>

        In India, transfer pricing is a relatively new but fast emerging field.
        Transfer pricing is a complex subject and impacts every area of business
        – ranging from associated party purchases, sales, financing instruments,
